This is a Test folder created by Dr. Stiel.

He ran some backrub runs on             :     1tro_cropped_renum.pdb_only_rings_WO_RINGS
They are in the folder                  :     BR_original
after that he ran a refinement on them  :     after_BR_and_FastRelax
and his position file w\ mutations      :     positions_mut_TS_LSorY.txt

The analysis is done by Mehdi Nellen, he also made the scripts.
profit analysis is in                   :     profit_rms
script to make profit code              :     make_profit_script.sh

Run it like this
    make_profit_script.sh reference.pdb mobiles_folder/ "xtra profit cmd" > output_profit_script.txt
    profit -f output_profit_script.txt > output_profit_results.txt

for example:
    sh make_profit_script.sh ../1tro_cropped_renum.pdb_only_rings_WO_RINGS ../after_BR_and_FastRelax/ "ALIGN WHOLE" > test.txt

These files were made using the previously stated script:
    after_BR_and_FastRelax_profit_results.txt  
    after_BR_and_FastRelax_profit_script.txt 
    BR_original_profit_results.txt  
    BR_original_profit_script.txt 

They will have to be analysed using some R script which generates density plots.
The original files also have to be be clusters and their dendrograms have to be plotted.
either by R or python, use the backrub module scripts for this.

script for making rms density plots     :       make_Rtable.R 
to calc RMS over zones use              :       make_iprofit_script.sh 

The R script takes the profit output textfiles as arguments
example usage:
    Rscript make_Rtable.R ../profit_rms/after_BR_and_FastRelax_profit_results.txt ../profit_rms/BR_original_profit_results.txt

The iprofit script maker needs an additional positions.txt as argument
    sh make_iprofit_script.sh ../1tro_cropped_renum.pdb_only_rings_WO_RINGS ../BR_original  ../positions_mut_TS_LSorY.txt > BR_original_iprofit_script.txt
